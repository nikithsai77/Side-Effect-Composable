//it has a parameter called produceState launches a coroutine it set the value of state and return it.
//producer launched when produceState enters the composition and will be cancelled when the producer state leaves the composition
//as well as it has a awaitDispose here we can clean up resource's.
//best use cases are LiveData, Flow, API, RXJava to use it here.
